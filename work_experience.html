	<h2>IBM (International Business Machines)</h2>
	<p class="bracket">{</p>
	<p class="indent">During my internship at IBM I made patches to an already existing internal project. These patches 
					  dealt with both functionality and unit testing for a continuous integration testing framework. 
					  I also worked alongside 3 other interns to develop our own continuous integration framework to test 
					  Openstack code. I used Linux to develop code in Python, Bash, and jinja2. I also worked with Ansible, 
					  writing new playbooks and roles in order to automate a testing framework.</p>

	<h2>REMC1</h2>
	<p class="bracket">{</p>
	<p class="indent">REMC 1 is an IT company for local school districts in the upper peninsula of Michigan and surrounding 
					  areas. I worked at this internship as I went to school. The job included answering the phone or talking 
					  to those that came to the office in order to help them with their various hardware or software issues. 
					  I worked on tickets to solve problems remotely, either over the phone, through SSH, or by RDP. The job 
					  involved mostly Windows but some work with Macs as well.</p>
